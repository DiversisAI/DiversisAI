Diversis started its journey in 2019 with a passion for artificial intelligence (AI) and spreading its benefits to society. We strongly believe in an AI-centric future that withholds unprecedented benefits to businesses that adopt and embrace advances in AI and machine learning (ML) in a timely manner. As an integral part of this vision, we dwell on interpreting AI-centric software with a different perspective and grasping how AI and ML ideas are applied in software or hardware along with their theoretical foundations.

Our mission is to put evolving AI and ML technologies into technical context and make it accessible to interested parties who aim to develop high technology products as well as developing highly tailored and optimized AI-centric software in a ready to use format.
